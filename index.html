    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Is a Miles&Smiles-Style Airline Credit Card?</h2>
      <p>An airline miles credit card linked to a program like Miles&Smiles replaces cashback with frequent-flyer miles. Every eligible transaction adds miles to your loyalty account, on top of the miles you earn from actually flying, creating a single pool of travel currency.</p>
      <p>Because the card is tied to one airline ecosystem and its partners, its usefulness depends on where you fly, how often you travel and whether you can realistically use award seats when you need them.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Earning -->
    <section id="earning" class="section">
      <h2>How Spending and Flights Earn Miles</h2>
      <p>Daily card spend earns a base rate of miles, while some categories — such as airline tickets, travel bookings or foreign-currency purchases — may earn a higher multiplier. Promotions, welcome bonuses and spend-based bonuses can accelerate your mileage balance early on.</p>
      <p>Flights taken with the airline or its partners usually add another stream of miles, based on distance, fare class or ticket price. The combination of card spend plus regular flying is what typically unlocks enough miles for long-haul or premium-cabin redemptions.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Redeeming -->
    <section id="redeem" class="section">
      <h2>Redeeming Miles for Flights and Upgrades</h2>
      <p>Miles can usually be redeemed for award tickets, cabin upgrades or mixed cash-and-miles bookings. The mileage cost of a trip depends on origin, destination, cabin, travel date and whether you book saver or higher-priced award types.</p>
      <p>Business- and first-class redemptions, as well as long-haul itineraries, often provide more value per mile than short-haul economy flights. However, seat availability and any carrier-imposed surcharges will strongly influence the real-world value of a redemption.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Partners & Alliances -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Partner Airlines and Alliance Redemptions</h2>
      <p>Programs like Miles&Smiles are typically part of a broader alliance and connect with several partner airlines. That means your miles can often be used on carriers beyond the home airline, giving you more freedom when planning complex or multi-leg journeys.</p>
      <p>Partner awards may follow their own pricing rules and surcharge structures. Before booking, it’s worth comparing different routing options and carriers to see which combination offers the lowest mileage cost and manageable fees for your itinerary.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Value & Suitability -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>When an Airline Miles Card Is the Right Tool</h2>
      <p>Airline miles cards tend to work best for travelers who fly at least a few times per year on the same airline group, especially on routes where cash tickets are relatively expensive. If you like to plan ahead and can be flexible with dates, award space can make premium cabins attainable for far fewer euros or dollars out of pocket.</p>
      <p>If your travel is infrequent, spread equally across many unrelated airlines, or dominated by low-cost carriers, a general travel-rewards or cashback card may provide more straightforward, predictable value than airline-specific miles.</p>
